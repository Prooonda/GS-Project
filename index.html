      We believe that war and terrorism contribute greatly to the deterioration of society in general <br>
      and in education in particular. We think that the key to improving society and economy in<br>
      a long term investments is through education. We think that a possible fix to this could <br>
      be through technology. In Syria Rebel groups are terrorizing villages because they don't<br>
      want children specifically girls to go to school. There has been several bombings nearby<br>
      schools in Syria destroying children's education. War is preventing more than 13 million <br>
      children to go to school also culture is affecting girls to go school because rebel groups<br>
      don't believe they should go to school. Girls in Pakistan are struggling to go to school. <br>
      Malala is a prime example of what is happening in pakistan and the taliban do not want girls<br>
      to go to school. Malala and other girls are writing articles to inform the world about the <br>
      taliban and getting the US and other developed countries to help stop the Talaban. In South <br>
      Sudan war prevents the government to pay for better education resulting in under qualified <br>
      teachers, and if teachers are under qualified  then the students get a bad education. <br>
      Also girls get improper education because the fathers are fighting in the war. It got so <br>
      bad there was a civil war in December 2013. Up to 300,000 people were killed in the civil<br>
      war with one ceasefire in January 2014. To conclude, we believe that warfare greatly negatively <br>
      impacts education</strong> </p>
