We believe that war and terrorism contribute greatly to the deterioration of society in general and in education in particular. We think that the key to improving society and economy in a long term investments is through education. We think that a possible fix to this could be through technology.

In Syria Rebel groups are terrorizing villages because they don't want children specifically girls to go to school. There has been several bombings nearby schools in Syria destroying children's education. War is preventing more than 13 million children to go to school also culture is affecting girls to go school because rebel groups don't believe they should go to school.

Girls in Pakistan are struggling to go to school. Malala is a prime example of what is happening in pakistan and the taliban do not want girls to go to school. Malala and other girls are writing articles to inform the world about the taliban and getting the US and other developed countries to help stop the Talaban.

In South Sudan war prevents the government to pay for better education resulting in under qualified teachers, and if teachers are under qualified then the students get a bad education. Also girls get improper education because the fathers are fighting in the war. It got so bad there was a civil war in December 2013. Up to 300,000 people were killed in the civil war with one ceasefire in January 2014.

      To conclude, we believe that warfare greatly negatively impacts education</strong> </p>
