    <h1> Affected Page</h1>
  <h3>Who is affected</h3>
    <p>We found that some of the most affected groups are the governments, the people, and the United Nations/the world.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Government</h3>
    <p>The individual governments are affected because there is less educated people to go into government  <br>
      and get good paying jobs and pay taxes.</p>
    <h3>People</h3>
    <p>People are affected because it is harder to get jobs and international support is much harder to come by.</p>
    <h3>United Nations</h3>
    <p>The Nuited Nations is affected because it is much eaiser to acheeve peace if people are educated and can understand <br>
   how the United Nations can help everyone if everyone works toghether.</p><br><br>

Our solution is United Nation safe zones to protect schools and other important education facilities.<br>

This solution has been used in the past but has worked because if Syrian refugees stay in one place ISIS<br>
    can figure out where they are hiding and attack them. If they want to establish safe zones they are going<br>
    to need protection from an army to do it.
